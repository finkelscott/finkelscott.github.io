<h1>Case Study: Package Analyzer</h1>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Open Source packages are increasingly used to build modern software. Licenses can conflict with one another, and as such it is important to understand package composition from a licensing perspective. Enter <strong>Package Analyzer</strong> &emdash; a tool designed to answer the question, <strong>&quot;What licenses are present in my product?&quot;</strong></p>
<section style="margin: 1rem 0">
    <p>Input: package.json</p>
    <p>Output: Visualization of metadata, license(s), version(s), and links for further exploration as needed.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
<p>The initial plan was to employ a textarea for JSON input. This would allow users to paste in their package.json file and see the results. However, this approach presented a couple of UX challenges during the testing phase:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The friction of having to open the file and manually select the contents is unnecessary.</li>
    <li>The JSON is sometimes large and complex, and there was a tendency to become distracted by the complexity and formatting, when the content of the file is not the focus.</li>
</ul>

<p>To address these concerns, I implemented a file-input approach that allows users to more simply select a package.json file for upload. This approach is faster and more intuitive.</p>
<br/>
<p>Including small touches like basic error handling, a count of dependencies and column sorting where it makes sense based on workflow (by Author, by License, by Name) enhances the user experience.</p>

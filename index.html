<h1>Hi!<br />I'm Scott, a software design engineer in San Diego, California.</h1>

  <div class="a"><h2>What I Do</h2></div>
  <div class="b">
    <h3>Software Product Ownership</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">Complex enterprise initiatives are my jam.</p>
    <p />
    
    <p>I'm a twenty-five year veteran of advanced engineering projects serving global audiences across the enterprise landscape. I have led a wide variety of web-based initiatives, including mobile productivity apps, open source software compliance tooling, document distribution portals, and much more.</p>

   <h3>Web Site Design &amp; Development</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">A well-designed site leads to business growth.</p>
    <p />
    <p>
      From static marketing sites to dynamic e-commerce platforms, I can design, build, and deploy the site or application you need to achieve your business goals. If you are looking for a custom web presence, please reach out via one of the links below. 
    </p>

         <h3>Prototypes &amp; Usability Testing</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">Iterate before you code.</p>
    <p />
    <p>
      Building fast and breaking things is expensive. Iterate faster with mockups and build the right thing the first time. Engaging with users early and often ensures the fit and finish of your application doesn't drift away from the features your users need to succeed. 
    </p>

    <h3>Front-end Engineering</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">Build, integrate, test, iterate.</p>
    <p />
    <p>
      Reactive functional paradigms on the front-end communicating with REST-based services on the back-end. I've worked with React, Typescript, Sass, Less, Stylus, and many other frameworks and libraries. 
    </p>

        <sl-divider></sl-divider>

    <h3>Technical Documentation</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">If it isn't documented, it isn't done.</p>
    <p />
    <p>
      Design docs, Help systems, User guides, FAQs, and Release notes are all fundamental to modern software development. These artifacts need not be dry and boring, but should engage users and lead them to success.

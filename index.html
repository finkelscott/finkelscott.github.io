<h1>Hi!<br />I'm Scott, a software design engineer in San Diego, California.</h1>

  <div class="a"><h2>What I'm good at.</h2></div>
  <div class="b">
    <h3>Business Process Mapping</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">Good design starts at the beginning.</p>
    <p />
    <p>By designing processes prior to look and feel, we examine the roots of the goal, consider the impact of information architecture, and provide a more holistic, scalable solution.</p>

    <h3>Prototypes &amp; Usability Testing</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">Iterate before you code.</p>
    <p />
    <p>
      Building fast and breaking things is expensive. Iterate faster with mockups and build the right thing the first time.
    </p>

    <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">A well-designed product is a joy to use.</p>
    <p />
    <p>
      Engaging with users early and often ensures the fit and finish of your application doesn't drift away from the features your users need to succeed. 
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Documentation</h3>
    <p class="merriweather-sans-light h3-tagline">If it isn't documented, it isn't done.</p>
    <p />
    <p>
      Design docs, Help systems, User guides, FAQs, and Release notes are all fundamental to modern software development. These artifacts need not be dry and boring, but should engage users and lead them to success.
